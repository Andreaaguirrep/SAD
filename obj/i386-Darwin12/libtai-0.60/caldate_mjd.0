[1mBASIC CONVERSIONS[0m
       Every  calendar  date has a [4mmodified[24m [4mJulian[24m [4mday[24m [4mnumber[24m.  The day number
       increases by 1 every day.  Day number 0 is 17 November 1858.  Day  num-
       ber 51604 is 1 March 2000.

       [1mcaldate_frommjd  [22mputs  into  [4mcd[24m  the date corresponding to the modified
       Julian day number [4mday[24m.

       [1mcaldate_frommjd [22malso computes the day of the week (0 through 6) and the
       day  of  the  year  (0  through 365).  It stores the day of the week in
       [1m*[4m[22mweekday[24m if [4mweekday[24m is nonzero.  It stores  the  day  of  the  year  in
       [1m*[4m[22myearday[24m if [4myearday[24m is nonzero.

       [1mcaldate_mjd [22mreturns the modified Julian day number corresponding to the
       date in [4mcd[24m.

       [1mcaldate_mjd [22maccepts days outside the range 1 to 31, referring  to  days
       before  the  beginning  or after the end of the month.  It also accepts
       months outside the range 1 to 12, referring to months before the begin-
       ning or after the end of the year.

       [1mcaldate_normalize [22mcalls [1mcaldate_frommjd [22mwith the result of [1mcaldate_mjd[22m.
       This means that it accepts out-of-range months and out-of-range days in
       [4mcd[24m, and puts a valid calendar date back into [4mcd[24m.

[1mOTHER FUNCTIONS[0m
       [1mcaldate_easter  [22mreads  the year from [4mcd[24m and then changes [4mcd[24m to the date
       of Easter in the same year.

[1mLIMITATIONS[0m
       The [1mcaldate [22mroutines currently support the  Gregorian  calendar,  which
       was  defined  in 1582 and adopted at different times in different coun-
       tries.  For earlier dates the [1mcaldate [22mroutines work with ``virtual Gre-
       gorian,''  defined  mathematically  by the 400-year Gregorian cycle for
       years before 1582.  The Julian calendar is not supported.

       The Gregorian calendar will be replaced by a new calendar within a  few
       thousand  years.   The [1mcaldate_frommjd [22mand [1mcaldate_mjd [22mroutines will be
       upgraded accordingly.  The current [1mcaldate_frommjd [22mand [1mcaldate_mjd [22mrou-
       tines are not useful for dates far in the future.

       Day  numbers  will  overflow  a  32-bit  [1mlong  [22msometime  after the year
       5000000; all systems should upgrade to 64-bit [1mlong[22ms before then.   [1mcal-[0m
       [1mdate_mjd [22mdoes not check for overflow.
