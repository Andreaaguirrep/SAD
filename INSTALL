<<How to compile SAD>>
*  General configuration
  1.  Copy sad.conf.sample to sad.conf and edit it.

     Usable configuration variable is shown below.

  SAD_ROOT	define SAD install prefix, if you need to instal.
  USE_X11	define as `YES', if you want to link X11 library.
  USE_TCLTK	define as `YES', if you want to link Tcl/Tk.
  USE_PYTHON	define as `YES', if you want to link Python.

     CAUTION:	Now X11 and Tcl/Tk linkage glue depend each other.
		You must set USE_TCLTK = USE_X11.
  
  2.  If you don't want Tcl/Tk or Python linkage, you can skip this step.
     Choose either getting archives by yourself(a) or using automatic fetch(b).

     a. Put 3rd party source archives into oldsad/distfiles directory.

     b. Install GNU/wget utility or set URI fetch command to FETCH variable,
	if you don't use 4.4BSD-Lite variant.
	(BSD extended ftp(1) is used on 4.4BSD-Lite variant)

  3.  Install GNU/make utility.

  4.  Run `make depend' on oldsad directory, if you modify sources.

  6.  Run `make all' on oldsad directory.

  7.  Run `make install', if you want install to SAD_ROOT.

  GNU make terminated normally, you could run SAD by gs driver script
 in SAD_ROOT/bin or oldsad/bin.
