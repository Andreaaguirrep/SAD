Description:
TaylorMap.n library provides global namescope function:
TaylorMap[begin:(_Real|_String), end:(_Real|_String), Options___Rule].
TaylorMap[] function generate Taylor map of beamline from `begin' to `end'
by using external differential algebra engine.

* Acceptable Beam Line Elements
  Translate:	DRIFT, BEND, QUAD, SEXT, OCT, CAVI, BEAMBEAM
  Convert:	MULT(K1 only)
  Discard:	MONI, MARK(Zero length element)
  Discard:	TCAVI, SOL, MAP(Not implemented on SAD+ engine)

* Acceptable Options
  Order:	Maximum order of Taylor series[Default: 1]
  Revolution:	Revolution number of expanded beamline[Default: 0]

* Return Values
  If successful, TaylorMap[] returns a List of Taylor map with the following
  coordinate order: x, Px, y, Py, z, Pz. Taylor map is a List of Taylor terms.
  Taylor term is a List constructed by a coefficient and order numbers of
  coordinate variable: {coefficient, n_x, n_Px, n_y, n_Py, n_z, n_Pz}
  It returns `$Failed' symbol on failure.

Bugs:
* Generated Taylor map MIGHT be broken in the case that
  either `begin' or `end' pointed the MARKer type element.
* SOL, MAP, TCAVI type element is not implemented on SAD+ endine 
* MULT type element is converted as Quadrupole element
  (Skew and higher order term is discarded)

History:
2005/01/31	First release
2006/02/01	Support MULT, SOL, MAP, TCAVI element(Incomplete translation)
2007/12/09	Follow module build framework changes
